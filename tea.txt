Tea is an awesome drink for me. Its mild flavor ensures that the one who drink
 it must calm down to perceive its subtle taste. It is somehow similar to the
 process of meditation that plenty of pleasure will arrive when the whole
 body is relaxed. As for type, I prefer black tea such as Jin Jun Mei Tea
 which is super fragrant.
